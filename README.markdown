# AppStoreHQ Deals SDK Implementation

----

This project allows you to see a working implementation of the AppStoreHQ Deals SDK.  If you're here, you might also find the [developer guide](http://www.appstorehq.com/deals/developer/guide) useful.

This project is meant to be run in eclipse.  You may need to go to Project -> Clean and clean the project if it won't run or you are getting dalvik errors.
